as i would return to this cup, it may have had an unfair uphill battle as i would think to myself “oh, this was the bitter one. yep, still bitter”.

 i had thought it was my least favorite of the four, but towards the end of the stream (but before the coffees were revealed) as i compared it to coffee c, the two seemed to almost switch places on me. c became what my initial impression of b was, and b became what my initial impression of c was. this could have been due to the fact that i was giving a and d more of my attention because i enjoyed them more and was more eager to return to them and crown a favorite, whereas i wasn’t as excited to return to b and c.",,,,tasted dark and winey. had a difficult time comparing c and b. they seemed to flip places on which i felt was more bitter and acid as i would sample between the two. ,,,,"very much enjoyed this coffee. tasted like a very juicy, dark blueberry and also of raspberries. had a difficult time choosing a favorite between a and d. 

while these were obviously prepared the same way, i almost liken their flavors to that of a pour over vs an espresso. coffee a was a great, well rounded coffee that i could drink every time i made coffee, ie a pour over. d was a more bold, explosion of flavor that was a delight to drink, but may tire out my tastebuds if i drank it every time i made coffee, ie espresso.
